Steps for filling in solar production information

<!--more-->

These are the steps for putting in the monthly solar panel production

### 1) Collect the data you will need

* Make sure you have username/password to login into the [mass-cec-pts.com][1] website

* Read production value and remember day/time of when you did the read. In my installation, the meter looks like this
  and the number you want to read is highlighted in the picture. So, in this particular picture, its 8736. Notice this
  is *not* the meter outisde the house, it is the (secondary) meter, which is co-located with the solar production system.
