Steps for turning metered data in Vietnam's cell into unlimited flat rate.

<!--more-->

While in Vietnam, I kept eating all the credits in the pre-apid card due to
data usage. Turns out there is a neat trick for stopping that. In essence,
what you can do is to pay a flat rate of 70k points and have unlimited data
for a month.

These are the steps for getting that:

1. Make sure you have at least 70k in the card. If not, buy some. You can see
   how many points you have by dialing **\*101#**

+ Send the following text to the number 999:     **dk miu**

Once you did that, you will no longer see your phone credits leaking away as you
send emails, check facebook or do any other data communication using your cell phone!
