Software development is nice, but who cares if that is all you are good at? A self evaluation of my professional skills made
me realize that I've grown 'unbalanced'. It is not as bad as it sounds, because I'm a pretty curious guy, and having been working
at start-ups pushes you to face new things _most_ of the time. But there is no question that my coding skills are light years ahead
of my English skills. :P

Enter Red Hat. Now, that is where the rubber meets the road. Not only the group is geographically dispersed, my team boundaries
blurry with a big community of folks who do not work for Red Hat. The concept of selling free software makes so much sense to me.
I still choose to take my car to the dealer, because I don't have any interest in changing its oil. Paying for that service is
something I do, gladly. Pushing it further, Red Hat pays me to contribute to a codebase it does not own. Turns out it is irrelevant
to own it; it is much more important to make it high quality and to know it inside out. Brilliant. So, while it is a self serving
prophecy, it is also a much less selfish one. I like it.

Back to the 'unbalanced' topic, what I realize now is that while I know how to write good code, I did not invest enough time in
learning how to publish my findings as I do the job. Well, if you look at my [Delicious] links -- which
I did manage to keep public -- you can actually see what I've been working on for the past few years. Still, that has big flaws:
the links of hobbies and work are all entangled, nevermind the fact that all I did was to take someone's work and time without
saying thanks, nor providing useful feedback.

Enter the tools for doing the job. From start, I thought the only skill I was seriously lacking for working with [OpenDayLight] was Java.
Man, was I wrong. Java is actually no big deal for some one who has done lots of object oriented work. Not to be underestimated, tho!

In my opinion, there are 2 fundamental pieces if you are seriously trying to be useful in an open source project: 1) do the work
instead of just talking about it; and 2) be good in showing what you did, with no ego. To do that effectively, a bunch of tools
are needed, so we can help folks -- and ourselves -- with pointers on the how-to's. As you can see, I'm brand new to
[Pelican]. Putting a page on what I did to get this blog online is next. :)

So, this is the _current_ list (by association order):

* Java
* OSGi
* Karaf
* Intelij (or Eclipse)
* Nexus
* Gerrit
* Jenkins
* Maven
* pip, Virtualenv
* Pelican
* Markdown
* Disquis
* IRC, Google Hangout, Webex
* Openflow
* OVS
* OVSDB
* Jackson
* OpenStack, Neutron
* DevStack, PackStack
* Docker
* [OpenDayLight][] (aka ODL)
* SDN
* NFV
* Linux network interfaces
* Yang
* Netconf
* VxLan, Geneva, GRE
* Trello
*  ... all the other stuff I do not even know exist ...

Thankfully, I already knew something:

* Git
* Github (or Bitbucket)
* Bugzilla 
* KVM
* Python
* JSON
* General linux knowledge
* SDN Affinity

Onto my adventures! I feel like a dog let loose in the sausage factory. My biggest chanllenge -- besides
having to learn like mad -- is to discipline myself in keeping the context switch penalty to a minumum. I am humbled and excited.
